# Axler-Linear-Algebra-Solutions

Solutions to [Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler, 3rd Edition](https://amzn.to/3y16aqJ).

Linear Algebra is my favorite subject and probably the most important math you'll learn in your life.

The PDF is located in the [`build/`](./build/main.pdf) folder of the repo.

## Note

I pretty much sped through this book (read it in about a week with solutions), so I ended up skipping a lot of problems. I still hope my notes and solution attempts are useful though.
