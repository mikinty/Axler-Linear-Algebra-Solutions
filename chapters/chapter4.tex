\chapter{Polynomials}

Short chapter let's go\dots

Not a huge fan of using the Complex Analysis Liouville's Theorem to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, but it works.

Okay yeah this chapter was truly short and I would say anyone who has taken Algebra II can probably skip this chapter.

I'm going to omit the exercises since there wasn't any new content introduced in this chapter.
