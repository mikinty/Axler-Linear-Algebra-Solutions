\section{Matrices}

Matrices are just a tool to represent linear maps, but they are no different or special.

\bx{
  We can imagine $\dim\vrange T$ as the number of linearly independent columns in the matrix, which has to be at least the dimension, and those are nonzero.
}

\bx{
  I think you just want to shift the constant term, so
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{matrix}
      a_1\\
      a_2\\
      a_3\\
      a_0
    \end{matrix}
  \end{equation*}
}

We didn't really learn much in this chapter except for matrix operations, so going to skip this.
