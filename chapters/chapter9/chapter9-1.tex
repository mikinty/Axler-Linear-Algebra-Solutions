\section{Complexification}

\begin{definition}
  Suppose $V$ is a real vector space.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{complexification} of $V$, denoted $V_{\C}$, equals $V \times V$. An element of $V_{\C}$ is an ordered pair $(u, v)$, where $u, v \in V$, but we will write this as $u+iv$.
    \item Addition on $V_{\C}$ is defined by
    \begin{equation}
      (u_1 + iv_1) + (u_2 + iv_2) = (u_1 + u_2) + i(v_1 + v_2), u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2 \in V
    \end{equation}
    \item Complex scalar multiplication on $V_{\C}$ is defined by
    \begin{equation}
      (a+bi)(u+iv) = (au-bv) + i(av+bu), a, b \in \R \text{ and } u, v \in V
    \end{equation}
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

This chapter was mostly formalities, felt logistics-like, just proving the same results from complex into the real space.

Don't really feel like doing these exercises...
